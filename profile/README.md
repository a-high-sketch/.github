## Frontend Microservice
The Frontend Microservice is the user interface of the Intelligent Image Analysis Platform. It's built with Next.js, Mantine, and TypeScript, running on a Node.js environment. This microservice allows users to upload images, view analysis results, and interact with other parts of the platform.

**Tech Stack**: Node.js, Next.js, Mantine, TypeScript  
**Responsibilities**:
- User authentication and authorization.
- Image upload and download.
- Displaying image analysis results.
- Interacting with other microservices via the API Gateway.

## API Gateway Microservice
The API Gateway serves as the entry point for external requests and directs them to the appropriate microservices. It's built using Go, ensuring performance and efficiency in handling network requests.

**Tech Stack**: Go  
**Responsibilities**:
- Routing external requests to the appropriate microservices.
- Load balancing to distribute network traffic.
- Error handling to manage failed requests.

## Image Processing and Analyzing Microservice
This microservice handles the core functionality of image analysis. It's built using Python, leveraging libraries like Pillow, OpenCV, and PyTorch for image processing and machine learning tasks.

**Tech Stack**: Python, Pillow, OpenCV, PyTorch  
**Responsibilities**:
- Image preprocessing and transformation.
- Applying machine learning models for image analysis.
- Returning analysis results to the API Gateway.

## Database Interaction Microservice
The Database Interaction Microservice handles all interactions with the database, ensuring data integrity and availability. It's built using Ruby on Rails, providing a robust framework for database operations.

**Tech Stack**: Ruby, Ruby on Rails  
**Responsibilities**:
- CRUD operations on database records.
- Data validation and integrity checks.
- Providing data to other microservices upon request.

## Logging and Monitoring Microservice
This microservice is responsible for logging events, monitoring system health, and alerting for any anomalies within the platform. It's built using Go, providing performance and scalability for handling logs and metrics.

**Tech Stack**: Go  
**Responsibilities**:
- Collecting logs and metrics from other microservices.
- Monitoring system health and performance.
- Alerting and notification in case of anomalies.
